# IMMUNOResource partial development [excluding source code that was NOT work on by myself]

## A simple addition to the IMMUNOResource webpage in typescript and CSS using react (found at immr.hanyang.ac.kr) which allows better readability and an efficient way to use and get around the website

This project assisted in adding readability and efficiency usage to the already existing database IMMUNOResource. The rest of this project is credited to hanyang BISLab and the source code for the rest will NOT be posted here.

*Assists in searching through the IMMUNOResource website
